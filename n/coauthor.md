# Git forge private emails

**_WARNING1 These are vendor lock-in and contribution activity will not
pass on to other platrforms._** It may not matter much with sign-offs though.

Forges generally have a feature for private email addresses and it can be
used at least by co-authored commits, e.g. [r/coauthor](/r/coauthor.html):

> `Co-authored-by: NAME <NAME@EXAMPLE.COM>`

or

> `Signed-off-by: Aminda Suomalainen <831184+Mikaela@users.noreply.github.com`

which is produced by `git commit -s`
