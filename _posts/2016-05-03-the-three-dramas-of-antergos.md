*I am not emotionless robot and I am able to make mistakes like anyone
 else. I am not a superhuman.*

## 2016-05-01

One user starts suggesting to ask support from Arch support channels
which is simply not OK and they are just causing harm to Antergos from
Arch side if they do that, no matter how much they edit `lsb_release`. I
get heated (I suffer from depression/anxiety/AvPD by the way) and kicked
them with message `first warning`. That was my mistake and it wasn't took
well and later when the user started commenting them I removed them instead
of kicking. This later caused long argument on operator channel where TL;DR
version is that they cannot understand that I am a human instead of
superhuman or emotionless robot.

The Antergos-ops part happened when I was at Gaymer's night and made the
mistake of being available. Thanks to the discussion I couldn't enjoy the
games, got suicidal, left the event, considered jumping under car or metro,
but instead asked at PirateIRC/#helsinki if anyone was at the pirate club.

There were people at the pirate club thanks to demonstration about
*blackmailing letters* (Google Translated word), so I went there instead.

Outside I met them and just cried and one of them hugged me and comforted
me and finally got out of me what had happened. Logs and then it has been
enough of this day, I guess.

[12:06:35] &lt;cedra&gt; if I wanted to just move from Antergos to Arch 
completely, would I have to reinstall it or can I really just remove 
[antergos] from the pacman.conf?
[12:13:05] &lt;ringo32&gt; you are already on arch
[12:13:08] &lt;ringo32&gt; cedra, 
[12:13:32] &lt;cedra&gt; yeah but like, what's the actual difference
[12:13:43] &lt;ringo32&gt; what is the differences ?
[12:13:49] &lt;cedra&gt; except for the packages that it installs
[12:14:03] &lt;ringo32&gt; antergos is not manjaro
[12:14:15] &lt;cedra&gt; Never tried manjaro
[12:14:51] &lt;ringo32&gt; Manjaro using own repo's and its quite suck to 
revert to arch... Antergos is stil arch with a repo of there own but 
most repos are arch
[12:15:16] &lt;cedra&gt; right so it's just the antergos repo?
[12:15:18] &lt;ringo32&gt; if arch is up2date antergos also
[12:15:27] &lt;ringo32&gt; is just antergos repo with there things
[12:15:32] &lt;ringo32&gt; is quite handy also
[12:15:51] &lt;cedra&gt; Neat
[12:16:13] &lt;ringo32&gt; nothing to bother to reinstall or remove something 
dont see a point
[12:16:15] &lt;ringo32&gt; ;)
[12:29:07] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; @cedra, reinstall
[12:29:54] &lt;cedra&gt; why's that
[12:30:19] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; because that way there won't be 
Antergos presets possibly causing issues.
[12:33:29] &lt;cedra&gt; hm. are there any common instances in which that has 
happened before?
[12:34:19] &lt;ringo32&gt; why reinstall :)

[12:34:41] &lt;ringo32&gt; what the hell is different  then :)
[12:34:54] &lt;Mikaela&gt; I don't know, but if you ask them support for Arch, 
they will just hate Angergos users more and the topic forbids that. Also 
if you just removed the Antergos repo, your system would still identify 
as Antergos which would also read in the logs.

[12:36:08] &lt;Jeannie&gt; Look what's inside the antergos repo
[12:36:16] &lt;Jeannie&gt; Everything else is arch
[12:36:29] &lt;ringo32&gt; but reinstall wont help
[12:36:31] &lt;Mikaela&gt; ringo32: Antergos identifies as Antergos unless you 
have old install, I think
[12:36:35] &lt;ringo32&gt; dont fix if aint broken
[12:36:43] &lt;ringo32&gt; ironic :p
[12:36:58] &lt;cedra&gt; I really just have the antergos-welcome package
[12:37:00] &lt;Mikaela&gt; or something has updated and changed it
[12:37:01] &lt;ringo32&gt; lsb_release is just a easy edit
[12:37:15] &lt;Jeannie&gt; My kernel identifies as 4.5.1-1 ARCH
[12:37:19] &lt;ringo32&gt; switch it off
[12:37:20] &lt;Mikaela&gt; ringo32: oh, that means you just chaged it, but are 
still running Antergos
[12:37:32] &lt;Mikaela&gt; Jeannie: which is just because it comes from Arch 
directly
[12:37:35] &lt;ringo32&gt; antergos is stil arch
[12:37:51] &lt;ringo32&gt; even antergos is an arch member ?
[12:37:57] &lt;ringo32&gt; unlike manjaro is not
[12:38:07] &lt;Jeannie&gt; Yes, and when I look at the antergos repo, I don't 
see tehnecessity for a reinstall if someone wants pure arch

[12:39:20] &lt;cedra&gt; Would it break something if I removed the 
antergos-keyring
[12:39:36] &lt;Mikaela&gt; ringo32: Antergos is not Arch. 
[12:39:46] &lt;Jeannie&gt; Antergos is arch
[12:39:48] &lt;ringo32&gt; you dont have to kick me, 
[12:39:57] &lt;Jeannie&gt; With a graphical installer and an additional repo
[12:40:17] &lt;ringo32&gt; Mikaela,  who makes the cinnamon packages ?
[12:40:25] &lt;Mikaela&gt; ringo32: how do I make the point across? 
[12:41:05] &lt;ringo32&gt; what the mather... antergos does atleast support 
arch better
[12:41:19] &lt;Mikaela&gt; Is Linux Mint Ubuntu? 
[12:41:55] &lt;ringo32&gt; i think you set the balance rough

[12:42:23] &lt;Jeannie&gt; Look at /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist, and tell me which 
servers that list points to
[12:42:42] &lt;Mikaela&gt; Jeannie: Is Linux Mint Ubuntu? 
[12:42:45] &lt;ringo32&gt; Mikaela,  look at the packager http://ix.io/yQB
[12:42:45] -FatalException- [http://is.gd/JPKaqO] (not a web page, 
content type: text/plain)
[12:42:53] &lt;Jeannie&gt; I don't care about *buntus
[12:42:58] &lt;ringo32&gt; Antergos support arch atleast
[12:43:04] &lt;ringo32&gt; where mint does not support ubuntu
[12:43:13] &lt;Jeannie&gt; And when I look at my mirrorlist, I see that it  
points to archinux mirrors
[12:43:26] &lt;ringo32&gt; Manjaro does not support arch
[12:43:35] &lt;ringo32&gt; there is the differences
[12:43:36] &lt;Mikaela&gt; ringo32: last time I checked, Linux Mint used 
Ubuntu repositories
[12:43:52] &lt;Jeannie&gt; When I run uname -r, I see I run an arch kernel
[12:44:20] &lt;Jeannie&gt; So If I use archlinux package mirrors nad an 
archlinuix kernel, which OS am I running?
[12:44:45] &lt;Mikaela&gt; 2016-05-01 12:42:45+0300 &lt; ringo32&gt; Mikaela,  look 
at the packager http://ix.io/yQB ==&gt; so? MATE packager is the maintainer 
of Ubuntu MATE last time I checked.
[12:44:45] -FatalException- [http://is.gd/JPKaqO] (not a web page, 
content type: text/plain)
[12:45:32] &lt;ringo32&gt; Nevermind
[12:45:49] &lt;Jeannie&gt; MATE 1.14
[12:45:51] &lt;ringo32&gt; you dont see my point 
[12:46:27] &lt;Jeannie&gt; I whish Wimpress would get his ass in motion and 
update the arch packages intead of messing around with ubuntu mate 16.04
[12:46:51] &lt;ringo32&gt; its arch-based sure
[12:47:06] &lt;ringo32&gt; but also i dont see a point to move out to arch 
also
[12:47:28] &lt;ringo32&gt; you are also direct on the arch repo's
[12:47:35] &lt;Jeannie&gt; So the fact that the Arch MATE maintainer maintains 
Ubuntu MATE too proves that antergos is not arch?
[12:48:03] &lt;ringo32&gt; at the end if arch breaks antergos breaks as well
[12:48:36] &lt;Mikaela&gt; I give up. Don't come crying to me on Arch 
communities hating you for not using Arch.
[12:48:53] &lt;Mikaela&gt; ringo32: most of times when Antergos breaks nothing 
happens at Arch
[12:49:21] &lt;Jeannie&gt; Which ARCH branch are you referring to with these 
breakages?
[12:49:29] &lt;Mikaela&gt; stable
[12:49:36] &lt;Jeannie&gt; So
[12:50:02] &lt;Jeannie&gt; If I use arch mirror servers  in my antergos, arch 
stable breaks and antergos doees not
[12:50:15] &lt;Jeannie&gt; ?
[12:50:47] &lt;Mikaela&gt; If you use Antegos and Antergos breaks, in most of 
cases it has been something from Antergos repo breaking. Nothing happens 
at Arch as it doesn't use Antergos repository as it's not Antergos.
[12:50:47] &lt;ringo32&gt; Mikaela,  just say your are on arch Wtf is so 
dificult
[12:51:23] &lt;ringo32&gt; what breaks is webkitgreeter
[12:51:31] &lt;ringo32&gt; thats the antergos story
[12:51:45] &lt;ringo32&gt; or the extentions mayby further ?
[12:51:54] &lt;Mikaela&gt; ringo32: Yes, I can say that as I am vanilla Arch 
user and am here just of kindness. Nothing forces me to be be here or 
help Antergos at all. However if you have installed using Antergos iso, 
you are Antergos user, not vanilla Arch.
[12:52:04] &lt;ringo32&gt; thinks kernel related is not really antergos
[12:52:18] &lt;Jeannie&gt; O
[12:52:20] &lt;ringo32&gt; i know your point
[12:52:32] &lt;ringo32&gt; its not vanila arch....
[12:52:51] &lt;cedra&gt; so if I were to remove the antergos-keyring, it would 
just break installing stuff from the antergos repo
[12:52:51] &lt;ringo32&gt; everything can breaks and such things, is also 
personal on users
[12:53:15] &lt;Jeannie&gt; If you use a third party repo, aur packages or a 
local repo, it's no vanilal arch either
[12:53:24] &lt;Jeannie&gt; Does thsi make the system not arch anymore?
[12:53:53] &lt;ringo32&gt; Mikaela,  on manjaro i uses 'unstable' repo and 
users from stable broke his system by update its also personal what you 
using
[12:54:30] &lt;ringo32&gt; sort of breakages or issues can be personal also
[12:54:41] &lt;Mikaela&gt; I said that I don't care, just go to #archlinux
[12:54:47] &lt;ringo32&gt; but i dont see a point to remove everything to have 
arch =-)

[12:55:19] &lt;ringo32&gt; i got a few atleast
[12:55:37] &lt;cedra&gt; What was that about some presets or something, 
someone mentioned that they can conflict with stuff

but you aren't willing to understand that so I just suggest you go to 
#ArchLinux and make them hate you.
[12:56:27] &lt;ringo32&gt; but kicking is rude
[12:56:35] &lt;ringo32&gt; did i use rude words?

other personal

[17:01:29] &lt;Calinou&gt; trying out Antergos KDE in VirtualBox :)
[17:01:41] &lt;Calinou&gt; found how to make it boot, using iomem=relaxed in 
kernel command line
[17:02:01] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; Hi
[17:02:45] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; Yes, vbox is buggy
[17:02:54] &lt;Calinou&gt; I plan to install Antergos on bare metal later
[17:03:00] &lt;Calinou&gt; but need Windows somewhere (virtual machine maybe)
[17:03:16] &lt;Calinou&gt; for running Adobe CC, what would you recommend? 
using VirtualBox Windows guest or KVM/QEMU?
[17:03:19] &lt;Calinou&gt; which one would be faster
[17:03:28] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; KVM
[17:03:47] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; VBox maybe has faster graphics 
performance
[17:04:02] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; KVM excels in nearly everything else
[17:04:17] *** Joins: FirePowi (~powi@powi.fr)
[17:04:28] &lt;Calinou&gt; yeah I've seen Phoronix benchmarks
[17:04:59] &lt;Calinou&gt; however there's a small concern, I'll occasionally 
use Premiere/After Effects
[17:05:04] &lt;Calinou&gt; is that even usable at low resolutions in a VM?
[17:05:09] &lt;Calinou&gt; nothing very intense
[17:05:21] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; It'll be usable
[17:05:28] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; Maybe a tad slow
[17:05:32] &lt;Calinou&gt; I have an i7
[17:05:36] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; Why not dual boot
[17:05:37] &lt;Calinou&gt; both desktop and laptop :)
[17:05:46] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; Nice
[17:05:49] &lt;Calinou&gt; maybe but dual booting is hard with UEFI and such
[17:05:55] &lt;Calinou&gt; I tried once, failed, I could boot only Fedora
[17:06:07] &lt;Calinou&gt; Windows was still physically present on the device 
though
[17:06:08] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; Not really
[17:06:21] &lt;Calinou&gt; I guess Antergos supports UEFI dual boot?
[17:06:53] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; Resize Windows partition, mount ESP 
in the right spot and create a partition for antergos
[17:07:15] &lt;Calinou&gt; I'll probably dual boot only on laptop, since it's 
my main machine for uni
[17:08:49] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; :)
[17:09:45] &lt;Calinou&gt; also how recent are Antergos packages compared to 
Arch? and what about stability? is it as stable?
[17:10:04] &lt;Calinou&gt; (never used Arch btw)
[17:10:10] &lt;Calinou&gt; but I'm a seasoned GNU/Linux user
[17:10:14] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; Antergos packages are as recent as 
Arch's
[17:10:37] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; And it's as stable as you want it to
[17:11:15] &lt;Calinou&gt; is upgrading packages weekly safe?
[17:11:22] &lt;Calinou&gt; say, I upgrade on weekends so that I can fix stuff 
up if it breaks

[17:18:29] &lt;Calinou&gt; KDE 5 is quite pretty

[17:18:40] &lt;Calinou&gt; those are so ugly

[17:27:14] &lt;Calinou&gt; Antergos can be installed in UEFI+GPT mode, right?
[17:27:28] &lt;Calinou&gt; do I need to pre-partition my drive using gparted

[18:44:09] &lt;Aria22&gt; guys, what's Telegram like? So far i've only been 
using WhatsApp.. none of my friends are on Telegram
[18:44:31] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;kerbingamer376&gt; I use it so much, I've never 
touched watsapp
[18:45:22] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;xikuuky&gt; @Aria22, It feels similar but it has 
stickers and more media types, channels, and large groups. It is also 
faster and more secure
[18:46:15] &lt;Aria22&gt; How did you get your friends on Telegram?
[18:46:25] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;kerbingamer376&gt; I just asked them
[18:46:36] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;kerbingamer376&gt; they just said, "yeah sure"
[18:46:40] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;xikuuky&gt; @Aria22, They didn't, I made a ton of 
friends here
[18:46:46] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;kerbingamer376&gt; Same
[18:52:38] &lt;Calinou&gt; hi, I installed Antergos on my PC in UEFI+GPT with 
manual partitioning
[18:52:45] &lt;Calinou&gt; now it's stuck in a boot loop whenever the SSD is 
plugged
[18:52:55] &lt;Calinou&gt; the PC tries to access UEFI, then reboots, 
indefinitely
[18:53:01] &lt;Calinou&gt; even if I press the key to go to UEFI
[18:53:13] &lt;Calinou&gt; tried switching UEFIs around (I have two on my 
motherboard)
[18:53:36] &lt;Calinou&gt; Aria22: here my friends use Telegram, thankfully
[18:53:41] &lt;Calinou&gt; WhatsApp and Skype are evil :)
[18:54:17] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;xikuuky&gt; @Calinou, Agreed
[18:54:23] &lt;Aria22&gt; Calinou: I agree with you on that...
[18:54:25] &lt;Aria22&gt; So is Facebook
[18:54:29] &lt;Calinou&gt; anyway I have a pretty bad problem :(
[18:54:33] &lt;Calinou&gt; not sure if I bricked the motherboard
[18:54:40] &lt;Calinou&gt; I did make an UEFI partition properly, the 
partition manager told me all was OK
[18:54:53] &lt;Calinou&gt; thing is, if I unplug SSD, I can eventually get to 
boot, with "no media found" message
[18:55:06] &lt;Calinou&gt; but then how do I reinstall Antergos on SSD (say, 
in BIOS mode)?
[18:55:11] &lt;Calinou&gt; since I don't think I can hotplug it
[18:55:32] &lt;Calinou&gt; motherboard is a MSI Z77 MPower by the way
[18:55:35] &lt;Aria22&gt; That goes far beyond what I know.. *waits for 
someone else to answer*
[18:55:46] &lt;Calinou&gt; at least I have my laptop for now, so I'm not left 
PC-less
[18:55:52] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;kerbingamer376&gt; * has never used ufei in his 
life *
[18:56:05] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;kerbingamer376&gt; uefi I mean
[18:56:29] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;kerbingamer376&gt; allways used bios mode
[18:57:24] &lt;Calinou&gt; I was able to boot in UEFI mode with Debian and 
Fedora
[18:57:45] &lt;Calinou&gt; my hardware is not very recent, the CPU is an 
i7-2600K, it's not like it's too recent
[19:02:43] &lt;Calinou&gt; guess I'll ask on forums as well
[19:06:25] &lt;Aria22&gt; Calinou: Maybe the SSD is broken, not the 
motherboard?
[19:06:42] &lt;Calinou&gt; Aria22: I would be very surprised... I installed 
Antergos on it just fine, without any errors in the process
[19:07:31] &lt;Calinou&gt; I will try unplugging it, installing Antergos on 
HDD, and see if it boots

[12:59:56] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; I should probably also talk here.
[13:00:23] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; We have users who think it's a good 
idea to edit /etc/lsb_release or whatever it is to say they are using 
Arch Linux Rolling and then go to Arch Linux support channels.
[13:00:48] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; I have tried to communicate that that 
is a bad idea and only makes Arch communities hate them and Antergos in 
general even more, but they aren't willing to listen.
[13:01:06] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; I am also sadly not emotionless 
machine and ended up first kicking and then removing one user.
[13:02:33] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; I also stated that I don't care 
anymore, people can call their Antergos Arch as much as they want and I 
don't care ops doing that either, they can only hurt themselves and 
Antergos. I have used vanilla Arch for a long time possibly even before 
I became Antergos op and I do it because of kindness just like the 
bridge bot between IRC and Telegram which is only getting negative 
feedback.
[13:03:29] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; It shouldn't also come as surprise 
that I am not mentally healthy and that I also have my limits. I wish 
there were multiple people present at all times who could handle the 
matter more peacefully.

[18:23:50] &lt;Wyn&gt; @Kissaela You can only do so much against stubborn 
users, don't put that on yourself.  But kicking the user is not what you 
should be doing, at all.  You are secondly pushing that user to go into 
the Arch channels by kicking this person.  If the telegram bot is 
getting "only" negative feedback, what is the feedback you have 
received?
[18:24:02] &lt;Wyn&gt; Should not be doing*.
[18:24:32] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; I cannot prevent users from doing 
what they wish and as I have said, I am not emotionless machine.
[18:25:00] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; The feedback I have gotten is that 
Telegram is horribly insecure and Antergos shjouldn't use it and promote 
propietary server software.
[18:29:39] &lt;Wyn&gt; @Kissaela It does not give you a right the kick 
ringo32.  You simply kicked without a discussion, and he's literally one 
of the more positive people on the channel.
[18:30:21] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; @Kissaela, IRC isnt more secure
[18:33:41] &lt;NanoSector&gt; Your kick doesn't make sense either

what do you want me to do?
[18:34:28] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; Is everyone else allowed to feel 
aggressive sometimes when they are angry, but not me?
[18:34:29] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; Why?
[18:34:35] &lt;NanoSector&gt; I don't want you to do anything
[18:34:49] &lt;NanoSector&gt; I'm just saying it doesn't make sense
[18:34:52] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; @Yoshi2889, IRC doesn't store 
conversations anywhere which is safe assumption. Telegram does.
[18:35:03] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; It does make perfect sense as I was 
angry and I am angry at you now.
[18:36:31] &lt;NanoSector&gt; Why, because i told you your kick doesn't make 
sense?
[18:36:56] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; Can someone explain to NanoSector 
that when people are angry they make inreasonable things?
[18:37:25] &lt;NanoSector&gt; "I am angry at you now"
[18:37:35] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; yes, because you cannot understand
[18:37:47] &lt;NanoSector&gt; Yes, i can
[18:38:55] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; Ringo tried having a mature 
discussion
[18:39:09] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; You kicked him for that
[18:39:11] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; Why?
[18:39:50] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; Why did you even get angry at him, I 
have the logs in front of me and don't see anything wrong
[18:40:13] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; No, I kicked him for getting angry 
for them repeating endlessly "Antergos is Arch" and "I can edit 
lsb_release so it says Arch and go to ask Arch for support"
[18:40:31] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; Why did that make you angry?
[18:40:43] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; because it's stupid and I have told 
them multiple times
[18:41:06] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; You could simply have said that you 
do not want such things in the channel
[18:41:25] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; and they would have went directly to 
Arch channels
[18:41:26] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; That it is against the rules
[18:42:02] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; I don't think it has been documented 
in the rules and I consider kicks as warning, as more action would have 
been remove
[18:42:07] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; If he then still wouldn't have shut 
up about it you could've kicked him for ignoring the warning
[18:42:28] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; Kicks aren't warnings, IMO
[18:42:40] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; they have been since IRC was invented
[18:43:05] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; In the SMF team I'd have my 
moderation powers suspended for an action like this
[18:43:17] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; And where is that said?
[18:43:18] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; bye
[18:43:29] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; I am leaving to cry somewhere now and 
if I decide to jump under metro thamk yourself of it
[18:43:48] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; Stop being such a drama queen
[18:47:58] &lt;Wyn&gt; reading this is embarrassing more then anything...like 
we already have enough on our plate regarding community activity
[18:51:32] &lt;Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Yoshi2889&gt; It sure is embarrassing

[19:08:25] *** ChanServ sets mode: +v SuchAntiSpam
[23:22:02] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; um ok wow so lets address this.
[23:22:28] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; Mikaela: a kick is not a warning . . . a 
"hey this is a warning, don't do blah", that's a warning.
[23:22:44] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; a kick is "GTFO but you can come back". Ban 
is GTFO forever.
[23:23:28] &lt;NanoSector&gt; yes, that is how i see kicks as well
[23:23:48] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; Antergos IS Arch technically speaking and if 
someone goes through the effort to try and solve their problem before 
asking in the Arch channels the Arch channels will be fine with helping 
Antergos users. I have discussed this with people in the Arch channels.
[23:24:28] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; the issue is Antergos brands itself as "for 
everyone" which is not true and thus brings in people who won't put any 
real effort in and then asking Arch channels without putting in effort . 
. . that is what they hate.
[23:24:40] &lt;NanoSector&gt; you do mean that we try to solve their problem 
first, right?
[23:24:54] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; I left helping in the Arch channel because I 
got sick of the Manjaro people yelling at me for not helping with a 
distro I wasn't even using.
[23:25:06] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; NanoSector: that's what I meant to say yes
[23:25:10] &lt;NanoSector&gt; aight
[23:25:19] &lt;NanoSector&gt; i didn't know that, but that's cool
[23:26:31] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; so yea the Arch channel does not hate people 
for asking help with Antergos, they hate it when people ask for help 
when they've not attempted to solve it themselves. Arch is all about 
"solve it yourself" first so that is perfectly reasonable stance.
[23:26:53] &lt;NanoSector&gt; that sounds reasonable indeed
[23:27:00] &lt;Wyn&gt; MichaelTunnell: also address this with Mikaela: 
&lt;@Teleuforia&gt; &lt;Kissaela&gt; I am leaving to cry somewhere now and if I 
decide to jump under metro thamk yourself of it
[23:27:18] &lt;NanoSector&gt; yes, that was uncalled for
[23:27:30] &lt;Wyn&gt; this type of stuff shouldnt be said here at all
[23:27:33] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; kicking people because you disagree with 
Antergos being Arch or not, is absurd and not acceptable. IT is NEVER 
acceptable to kick someone just because of a difference of opinion.
[23:28:11] &lt;NanoSector&gt; MichaelTunnell, i did try to explain exactly 
that
[23:28:56] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; Mikaela:  you are certainly entitled to be 
angry but you have power in this community, power that others do not so 
NO you do NOT have the right to invoke that power just because you are 
angry. If you become angry and want to not continue the conversation 
then, leave the conversation.
[23:29:24] &lt;NanoSector&gt; and that is easier said than done
[23:29:45] &lt;NanoSector&gt; but just count to 10 before replying, it helps
[23:29:46] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; NanoSector: certainly, I agree. I have had 
to stop myself on multiple occasions but the thing is, I always stop 
myself.
[23:29:56] &lt;NanoSector&gt; yes, i am guilty of that too
[23:30:09] &lt;NanoSector&gt; but sometimes i don't stop
[23:31:15] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; Mikaela: in relation to the leaving to cry. 
That is unfortunate and I wish nothing but the best for you. However, 
you made a mistake and that is that. You have to just deal with the 
mistake and try to make up for it.
[23:31:23] &lt;NanoSector&gt; either way i wasn't trying to pick a fight with 
the convo today or even try to make anyone angry
[23:31:47] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; NanoSector: I know, I'm just responding to 
the parts where I think I should.
[23:32:23] &lt;NanoSector&gt; yes, that's fine, i'm just outputting my 
thoughts
[23:32:40] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; Telegram does have less security in a very 
very nice sense of having a central server. That's why I want the bot 
renamed to Telegram something so people know it's happening immediately. 
If they want to leave the chat because of it then that is fine.
[23:33:07] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; Telegram was a fantastic idea to be added to 
the channels and it has brought more activity from Antergos team in, 
that by itself is worth it for the channel.
[23:33:15] &lt;NanoSector&gt; doesn't freenode have central servers as well, 
though?
[23:33:28] &lt;NanoSector&gt; even though they supposedly don't store messages
[23:33:40] &lt;Wyn&gt; I brought up the bot being renamed to Telegram as well.
[23:33:43] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; NanoSector: I think so but I can't guarantee 
on the message part
[23:34:07] &lt;NanoSector&gt; either way it's irrelevant, they're both not 
secure as anyone could just join and publish the logs somewhere
[23:34:17] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; NanoSector: agreed
[23:34:41] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; which is why I want it obvious and then 
users can decide to care or not. This way we never have to care. :)
[23:34:49] &lt;NanoSector&gt; true
[23:35:04] &lt;Wyn&gt; thats what i said 2+ weeks ago lul
[23:36:19] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; that final thing I will comment on. Mikaela 
telling people to blame themselves for a terrible decision of suicide is 
appalling and not remotely acceptable. If you do decide to do it, which 
of course I hope you don't because that would be awful . . . but if you 
do, that would be your decision, not anyone here or in the main channel.
[23:36:39] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; yes there are people who are vile assholes 
in some places but that's not us so to say that is offensive to us.
[23:37:26] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; well at least it is offensive to me . . . I 
can't speak for everyone but I'd comfortable with assuming they agree.
[23:38:39] &lt;NanoSector&gt; i felt bad and kind of angry because i was the 
one being blamed while i didn't intend any harm
[23:39:36] &lt;NanoSector&gt; so, apologies for my drama queen comment
[23:40:49] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; NanoSector: I understand. I would feel the 
same. I hate to hear people talking about killing themselves. I know 
people who have done it and it is something I'll never truly get over 
but to blame others for that action is appalling to me.
[23:41:11] &lt;NanoSector&gt; :(
[23:41:42] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; I often try to help those who express such 
comments but I'm not a doctor so I can't truly do anything but listen 
and I always try to be there for people who want me to be but even then 
that's not enough.
[23:42:46] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; I realize that and I couldn't help the 
person who I knew that did it but that does not mean it was my fault or 
anyone else's so that kind of statement infuriates me. In the most, 
understanding and sympathetic way possible.
[23:42:54] &lt;NanoSector&gt; you're doing your best MichaelTunnell
[23:43:10] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; All problems are temporary problems and 
suicide is a permanent solution to temporary problems.
[23:44:14] &lt;MichaelTunnell&gt; NanoSector: I like to think so

## 2016-05-02

The Antergos drama isn't over and I had therapy session in the beginning
of this day. However I really didn't want to talk about yesterday, so
I lied about there being nothing (sorry).

Afterwards the new drama starts, I am added to Telegram groupchats
(practically meaning no logs) and if you have read more of my blog than
just this, you can probably think by yourself why I got upset.

Group1: Arabic spam where I just reported it as spam and left and changed
my privacy settings that only my contacts (people who have my number) can
add me to groups.

Group2: Here I was added by contact, friend of pre-transition-me whom with
I have had no contact since then with one exception of when I joined
Telegram and they got notification of it.

Anyway, back to the group. Entirely random people where I see my name
mentioned multiple times and some NSFW material (at family friendly
group?). I replied to those lines that "yes, they should add me to the
group if they asked me and I said yes" and "I am not interested in NSFW
groups" or something like that (there being logs would be easier).

I left (without reporting the group for spam as people who have your phone
number for whatever reason just cannot be spammers) and discussed it
with the person doing the adding and person whom I thought was my friend.

With person 1, I requested them to not add me to groups without asking me
first, linked to my blog for explanation and also suggested them to read
Telegram spam FAQ to understand what people can consider as spam.

With person 2, I gave screenshots of relevant parts of the discussion with
person 1, who then went "I don't believe person 3 has done any emotional
abuse" and went to talk about person 3 about it which when I learned it
caused me to just block both people after saying person 2 "You don't go
to rapist telling that their victim has bad experience with them" and if
you know my temper already, you understand the question I asked also before
blocking "why do I have to go to absolutes with everyone?".

I also removed person 2 from my IRC channel which made them go to entirely
unrelated channel and take the drama there (which has it's own share of
drama and really doesn't need other dramas) calling me as false-friend and
telling me to stop playing with their feelings (having feelings is
apparently a privilege and I am not allowed to have them, they have no idea
on drama #1 though even if I mentioned it).

And as I said, this was Telegram and I have no logs, so we can probably
return to Antergos and the drama number three.

* [Antergos irc forum problems @ Antergos Community Forum](https://forum.antergos.com/topic/4407/antergos-irc-forum-problems/10)

Flashback to drama #1, you should by now have a good idea on what
happened and in case you know me or my blog, you don't need to have
the facts, but I must probably explain them to new readers.

First we must probably visit the rules of the IRC channel to know 

> General talk about other topics is allowed if it does not interfere with
> the main topic of the channel.

And then to the other things that were said.

0. You now by now that I am not entirely mentally healthy, but what is not
said yet is that at nightime I get often worse and can be more talkative
about transness than on other times.
1. I have no sexual problems/frustation. I am happy and proud asexual
which means I don't feel sexual attraction towards anyone. I also don't
feel "sexual desire" at all and have no idea what is this person talking about.
2. Yes, I will have orchiectomy which is removal of testicles hopefully in
near future. Thank you for giving me the excuse to talk about it on my blog
as I might not go to futher surgeries after that and trans women who only
get orchiectomy are stealth or not so visible for other reasons and
I can be as visible as I want on my blog and hopefully help others
that way. I often get feedback on IRC thanking either of my IRC
related articles or making them understand LGBT\* issues better etc.
3. Who was banned? I don't remember banning anyone or doing it by
personal preferences, but if we were Ubuntu or someone else, you
would have violated the Code of Conduct and would have good reason
for banning.

## Bottom line

*The best weapon against the lies is the truth.*

This is what happened from my point of view with feeling suicidal three
times. I am a human with feelings/emotions, not superhuman or robot
without them. This means that I also make mistakes and I am sorry for
them.

However I again feel better after writing this and I should really write
more.

## More about me

In case you are interested in reading more about me, I suggest

* [/about](/about) which is my about page and in the bottom contains
  links to my-life-related posts where this one doesn't belong due to
  happening mostly online.
* [/irc](/irc) for the previously mentioned IRC posts which also include
  two posts about umode+g which explain why I am unhappy with private
  messages which come without my explicit permission.
* [/blog](/blog) for the other blog posts I have written about random
  subjects.
