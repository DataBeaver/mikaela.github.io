I felt like my biography (that less than 140 characters thing you see at
all my profiles) had been unchanged for some time and had some issues, so
I changed it.

> \#GirlsLikeUs â™¥ AS â™¥ Feminist ðŸ‚± Linux user since 2008 â™¥ she/her/hers

* [For #GirlsLikeUs, please see here.](http://janetmock.com/2012/05/28/twitter-girlslikeus-campaign-for-trans-women/)
* AS, I am person with Asperger's Syndrome.
* Feminist shouldn't need opening, but it's explained in my [about page].
* I am romantic asexual and even if your browser or whatever service you
  use to see my profile doesn't show the [Ace of Hearts], you see that I
  am Feminist using Linux which I also am.
* I cannot assume people to know which pronouns to use as even if I am
  trans woman, I could have strong preference to some other pronouns
  such as [singular they](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they).
    * *I am OK with all gender neutral pronouns with the exception of
       s/he or (s)he or similar which just attmpt merging binary genders
       together.*
