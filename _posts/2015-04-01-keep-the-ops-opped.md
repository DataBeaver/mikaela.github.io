Why I think that you should keep the ops opped instead of following
freenode's recommendations.

*Tired blogging, this will probably have a need for lot of fixing after I
am more awake if I ever am...*

Is there issue with your channel? What will people do? They will go to
some other channel to say that there is spam on your channel forgetting
to ping you about it.

Yes, of course there is `/msg chanserv access #channel list`, but who
really uses that, especially from newer users? Probably no one and if
you have larger channel with multiple ops, it requires whoising the
whole lot of you to see who is not away and has lower idle time (even if
the idletime might not mean anything if the op uses OTR and other reasons).

And there is also the issue of having to trust services or your bots.
What if the services go down or netsplit and the same happens to your bot?
You are out of luck unless you had the ops opped in which case the outage
doesn't affect you that much at all.
