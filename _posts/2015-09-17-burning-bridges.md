I finally did it, removed my access to channels I will never be on again
and here I tell it to everyone and why I left the channels.

And short stories about what these channels are:
* ##not-a-honeypot and #limnoria are detailed in my two other blogposts,
basically they have issues with either women or trans people and one had
my ex.

    * https://mikaela.info/english/2015/05/18/life-bot-background.html
* #ircassholes is dead and I haven't been in speaking terms with the
  founder in a long time.
* #suicidewatch and #sw-defocus I was on a long time and stayed there
  after coming out in hope I could help other trans/autism spectrum
  people, but being there was too much for me and I ended up leaving at
  some point. I also have issue of feeling like I don't deserve to be
  there.
* ##matrixiumn, I think we are still in speaking terms, but that channel
  had discussions I didn't like so much.
* ##asexuality, here I was co-founder until someone who believes they can
  decide identities of other people for them and know them better than the
  people by themselves came and after that my flags were decreased to
  those of regular user without any kind of explanation no matter how much
  I asked. I decided that I won't be bullied there and I have substituted
  this with IRL peer support, [HeSeta's Asexual evenings (in Finnish)](http://www.heseta.fi/aseksuaalisuudesta). There is also still ##abgilpqt+
