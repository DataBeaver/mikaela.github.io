*A frequently asked question: "what does hau mean?" To avoid repeating
 myself, I will explain it here.*

"Hau" is what dogs "say" in Finnish (they also "say" some other things such
as "vuh").

At first I just greeted [Tessu] and family members by saying "hau" and then
it widened to IRC & elsewhere.

It cannot be any worse greeting than "hai" (below) which some people use.
