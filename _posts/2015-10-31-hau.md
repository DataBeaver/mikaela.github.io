*A frequently asked question: "what does hau mean?" To avoid repeating
 myself, I will explain it here.*

"Hau" is what dogs "say" in Finnish (they also "say" some other things such
as "vuh").

At first I just greeted [Tessu] and family members by saying "hau" and then
it widened to IRC & elsewhere.

It cannot be any worse greeting than "hai" (below) which some people use.

*Update: add some point I started saying "mau" instead which is what
 the cats say in Finnish, but why not as it only changes one letter.*

*This is probably caused by the fact that I moved away from Tessu and
 [Karou from the Daughter of Smoke & Bone](/r/karou) was very easy to
 identify with in the first book.*
