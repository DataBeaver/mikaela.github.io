*There appears to be a lot of confusion on IPv6 and in this post I try to
 clear it a little.*

I am writing this post, because [TorrentFreak wrote about buggy ÂµTorrent and suggests disabling IPv6 because of it.](https://torrentfreak.com/popular-torrents-being-sabotaged-by-ipv6-peer-flood-150619/)
The comments of that post are also totally lost.
