*As some people already know, I am currently re-reading The Farseer Trilogy
 because I learnt there are more books that are located in the same world.
 I didn't remember there was anything gender related there, but there was
 and it's too good to not share.*

<pre class="irclog">
* Fitz: *warningly* Fool
* Fool: Ah. Perhaps the truth is, I fear to show her my proof, lest ever
  afterwards she find all other men a disappointment. What does it matter
  what she thinks? Let her think whatever is easiest for her to believe.
* Fitz: Meaning?
* Fool: She needed somone to confide in and, for a time, chose me. Perhaps
  it was easier for her to do that if she believed I was a woman, also.
  That is one thing that in all my years among your folk I have never
  become accustomed to. The great importance you attach to what gender one
  is.
* Fitz: Well it is important...
* Fool: Rubbish. Mere plumbing when all is said and done. Why is it
  important?
* Fitz: *at a loss of words*
* Fitz: Could you not simply tell her you are a man and let the issue be
  laid to rest?
* Fool: That would scarcely lay it to rest Fitz. For then she would need
  to know why, if I am a man, I do not desire her. It would have to be
  either in me, or something I perceived as a fault in her. No. I do not
  think anything needs to be said on that topic. Starling, however, has
  the ministrel's failing. She thinks that everything in the world, no
  matter how private, should be a topic for discussion. Or better yet,
  made into a song. Ah, yes!

*Fool makes a mocking song imitating Starling.*

* Fitz: Did you ever stop to think you might hurt her feelings?
* Fool: I gave it as much thought as she gave to whether such an allegation
  might hurt mine.
* Fool: Admit it. You asked that question with never a thought as to
  whether it would hurt my vanity. How would you feel if I demanded proof
  that you were a man? Ah! Such a thing to waste words on, with all else
  we must confort. Let it go Fitz, and I will as well. Let her refer to me
  as "she" as much as she wishes. I will do my best to ignore it.
* Fitz: It is only that she thinks that you love me.
* Fool: I do.
* Fitz: I mean, as a man and a woman love.
* Fool: And how is that?
* Fitz: I mean.... For bedding. For...
* Fool: And is that how a man loves a woman. For bedding?
* Fitz: It's a part of it.
* Fool: You are confusing plumbing and love again.
* Fitz: It's more than plumbing!
* Fool: I see. Tell me, Fitz, did you love Molly or that which was under
  her skirts?
* Fitz: I love Molly and all that is a part of her
* Fool: There, now you have said it. And I love you, and all that is a
  part of you. And do you not return that to me?
* Fitz: You know I love you. After all that has been between us, how can
  you even ask? But I love you as a man loves another man ...
* Fool: *jumps to fallen log crying dramatically* He loves me, he says!
  And I love him!
