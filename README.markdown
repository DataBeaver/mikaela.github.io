My website

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Mikaela/mikaela.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Mikaela/mikaela.github.io)

Directories:

* PGP/ — my PGP key(s)
* \_\*/ — Jekyll's own files
* blog/ — blog index & feeds
* css/ — css
* pages/ — normal pages
* php/ — php scripts that haven't found their way anywhere else
* r/ — redirects, some kind of personal URL shorrtener

Sitemaps:

* sitemap.xml — automatically generated by Jekyll when building
* sitemaps.xml — manually written sitemap index pointing to sitemaps on my
  sites. I am not sure how it works when there are multiple domains, so
  I am keeping all sitemaps in robots.txt and sitemaps.xml on bottom
  of it. Same will possibly happen with other domains.
