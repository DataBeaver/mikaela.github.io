So you have discovered that I am trans? What should you do? It has nothing
 to do with you, so do nothing, just treat me like you would any other
 woman.

I also don't want to discuss it with you as you are most likely missing
understanding on the subject and either would make me feel very
uncomfortable (maybe even offend me without meaning to) or force me to
be a teacher which I don't want to.

Another thing that you should keep in mind is to **never tell anyone else**
about my transness (or any other feature e.g. aspiness) as in this world
that could make them think very differently about me or make me bullied
even more or worse. Let me tell by myself if I see reason for it.

And even if this should be obvious I sadly have to point out that I don't
try to trick you believing that I am a woman, because I am a woman.
Claiming that I was a man would be lying to you.
