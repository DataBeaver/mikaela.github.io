*I often end-up installing addons without having syncing available, so this
 is a living list of the essential ones I will always miss and a few
 extras.*

Oops, this has been living on the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/Mikaela/mikaela.github.io/issues/106) 
since 2017-12-25 with the latest addition being 17 days ago...

I think I will just put extensions that I am not actively using with
the rest of the extensions as long as I can recommend them to people or
this would become even more confusing.

## Firefox containers

I love them ðŸ’œ, don't you? Multiple instances of web apps and with some
helpful extensions Facebook and Google automatically separated to their own
containers and hopefully leaking a bit less my browsing habits. I
especially ðŸ’œ not using Facebook and having random links from IRC open in
a dedicated container which hopefully looks more like a random user from
the same IP (Carrier Grade NAT or different PC user or similar) than me.

* [Facebook Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/)

> Prevent Facebook from tracking you around the web. The Facebook
> Container extension for Firefox helps you take control and isolate your
> web activity from Facebook.

Oops, I explained why I love this above already.

* [Google Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-container/)

> THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL ADDON FROM MOZILLA!
> It is a fork of the Facebook Container addon.

> Prevent Google from tracking you around the web. The Google Container
> extension helps you take control and isolate your web activity from
> Google.

* [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/)

> Firefox Multi-Account Containers lets you keep parts of your online life
> separated into color-coded tabs that preserve your privacy. Cookies are
> separated by container, allowing you to use the web with multiple
> identities or accounts simultaneously.

I have understood that this is part of Firefox since I forgot and am too
lazy to check, but this extension anyway allows naming/creating/renaming
and otherwise managing containers and jumping to them easily.

## Privacy

* [Cookie Autodelete](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/)
    * [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-autodelete/fhcgjolkccmbidfldomjliifgaodjagh)
