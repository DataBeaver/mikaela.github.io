I have a [PUBLICly logged](https://view.matrix.org/room/!ZFnQcqwxcebAepncKr:feneas.org/) instant messaging chatroom for comments to my
blog and other things I do. They are connected together by [Matterbridge](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/#matterbridge).

I am not writing any rules down yet, but I appreciate treating everyone
with basic politeness. Moderators are free to act as they think and feel is
the best, while I hope removals won't be necessary.

  * Additional aliases can be added by `!altalias publish <alias>`, while
    those may not provide additional value due to Matterbridge being a
    central single point of failure to other protocols.

    of writing, livestreaming is only in development branch.
