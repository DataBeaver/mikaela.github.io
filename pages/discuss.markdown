I have a [PUBLICly logged](https://view.matrix.org/room/!ZFnQcqwxcebAepncKr:feneas.org/) instant messaging chatroom for comments to my
blog and other things I do. They are connected together by [Matterbridge](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/#matterbridge).

As [Code of Conduct, Contributor Covenant applies](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/).<br>
I don't see a reason for forking it as this community is forming around me
and my website while I would have separate community for any actual Open
Source Software project if I begun any that grew bigger.

As for languages; English is preferred due to majority of the discussion
participants speaking it, but Finnish and Esperanto are also fine.<br> I sadly
don't consider myself capable of holding a discussion in other languages, but
I do hope to be able to grow this list in the future.

  * Additional aliases can be added by `!altalias publish <alias>`, while
    those may not provide additional value due to Matterbridge being a
    central single point of failure to other protocols.
