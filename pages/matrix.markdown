Just like [IRC](/irc/), *Matrix* has became a part of my social life online. My
room can be found from [my discuss page](/discuss) alongside
some protocol comparison and my accounts are in [index](/).

I also have a [txt with list of my accounts](/txt/matrix.txt) which [has SSH signature](/txt/matrix.txt.sig).
