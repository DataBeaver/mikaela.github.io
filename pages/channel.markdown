Rules of my IRC channels that may or may not exist with multiple names
in multiple networks.<br/>Definition of my channel: A) the channel links
here in topic/entrymsg/URL B) I am the only founder C) B + there are
no other rules.

* [More about my bot (which might or might not be on this channel) here.](bot.html)

* **Use common sense.**
* Be nice, no phobias or \*isms.
    * Mind your language, not everyone is e.g. your brother ("bro"), don't
      swear or use slurs.
    * In case you aren't sure which pronouns to use about someone else,
      please use [singular they](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they)
    * Clearly tell when links aren't safe for everyone by prefixing them
      with `[NSFW]` or similar.
    * Respect boundaries, don't PM people without asking first.
* Don't log the publicly channel.
* Don't bring bots to the channel without asking me first.
* If you need help from channel op, ping them or PM them (keep in mind that
  they might not want PMs and block all PMs by default) or depending on
  the network and your flags (if you are voiced this probably works),
  `/msg memoserv sendops #channel message here`.
    * If there are no ops present, ask network operators. They should be
      on the access list.

Furher reading:

* [Ops on my channels should always be opped.]({% post_url 2015-04-01-keep-the-ops-opped %})
* [On blocking all PMs by default.]({% post_url 2015-04-02-umode+g %})
