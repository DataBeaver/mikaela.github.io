* [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/Ciblia)
    * very silent, I am more active with GitHub…
* [Facebook](https://facebook.com/mikaelahmsuomalainen) 
    * I only previously accepted friend requests from people I knew
      anywhere like IRC, but I have moved to just accepting all requests
      as long as I have some kind of idea on the person and they seem sane.
      If I know you at IRC or somewhere, sending message with mentioning of
      that would be helpful.

      including forks where I don't contribute so actively.
