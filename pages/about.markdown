On this page I am trying to explain myself more or those things that you
might wonder in my self-description. Some things that I explain here may
overlap with different features.

## GirlsLikeUs â€” I am trans woman

It simply means that I was incorrectly defined as boy at birth which I
never was.

## AS - Asperger's Syndrome

I am AS-person and you might see it from the way I write and speak. I have
some over-sensitive senses like sense of hearing and it becomes difficult
for me to speak if I try to look into your eyes at the same time, so I am
not trying to be impolite or anything, it's just easier to not look at you
while I speak. Same applies to understanding your speaking.

## Feminist

I support equal rights for everyone and the right of self-definition (or
not requiring anyone to define themselves). Everyone should also be the one
to choose what they do with their body (abortion, gender transition etc.)
freely without complicated researchs and other people or society judging
them.

## Linux user

I have been used Linux since 2008, I started with [Ubuntu] \(8.04) which I am
still using. My preferred distribution is [Ubuntu MATE] or
[Ubuntu Server], but I am also familiar with other distributions, mainly
[Debian]-deriatives. 

I have experience with [Fedora] and other distributions from that side too
and I am not entirely lost while using them, but somehow I have always
preferred Debian side. Maybe it's just that I have learned to use it.
