I am on multiple IRC networks, but finding me should be easy. I am mostly
using nicks Mikaela, Anima or Ciblia and I am on umode `-i`, so you should
be able to find me easily with `/whois nick nick`. `/nickserv info nick`
can also be helpful.

To check that it's me, you can use OTR and check [my OTR key.](../keys)
