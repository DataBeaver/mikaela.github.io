I am on multiple IRC networks and finding me on those should be easy as
(depending on network) my channel list is mostly visible with
`/whois Mikaela Mikaela`. I also recommend checking
`/msg NickServ info Mikaela`.

*To verify that you are talking to me, I encourage you to check
[my OTR key] which will also verify my identity even if I was using
different nick which is possible depending on network.*

[my OTR key]: ../keys

**My policy on joining personal channels**.

*If you have no idea what this section means, this most likely doesn't
concern you. (Hint: For example `##nickname` channels at freenode.)*

I often feel that personal channels are useless and not so good invention,
but they might have some uses like commit spam or spamming some RSS feeds.

My current policy on joining them is joining channels of those people who
join mine and are preferably voiced or higher, but I reserve the right to
not do that or leave the channel at any time without specifying reason.
