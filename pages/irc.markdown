I am on multiple IRC networks, but finding me should be easy. I am mostly
using nicks Mikaela, Anima or Ciblia and I am on umode `-i`, so you should
be able to find me easily with `/whois nick nick`. `/nickserv info nick`
can also be helpful.

To check that it's me, you can use OTR and check [my OTR key.](../keys)

## IRC. subdomain

[irc.mikaela.info](ircs://irc.mikaela.info:6697) is currently manually
updated mirror of [irc.queertech.systems](ircs://irc.queertech.systems:6697)
and it should give you some of the fingerprints below, otherwise there is
MITM-attack going on and you **should disconnect**.
