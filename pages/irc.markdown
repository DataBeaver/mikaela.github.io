I am on multiple IRC networks and finding me on those should be easy as
(depending on network) my channel list is mostly visible with
`/whois Mikaela Mikaela`. I also recommend checking
`/msg NickServ info Mikaela`.

*To verify that you are talking to me, I encourage you to check
[my OTR key] which will also verify my identity even if I was using
different nick which is possible depending on network.*

[my OTR key]: ../keys
