This page tells a little about my IRC bot. Please see also
[channel rules.](channel.html)

* [Web interface](https://bot.mikaela.info)
    * [Plugin documentation](https://bot.mikaela.info/plugindoc/)

The bot might or might not reply to you as it can be configured to

* reply only to identified users
* configured to not reply on the channel
* configured to reply only owner

The bot can also be requested to join other channels, but I reserve the
right to not join it anywhere or to not register specific channel ops
to the bot. It doesn't have open registration. The bot should also have
it's channel list visible in whois.
