# {{site.ipfsGateway}}/ipfs/IPFSHASHHERE to get ipfs link via gateway.
# Hopefully future proof letting me simply swap the link here instead of
# changing it everywhere.
# IMPORTANT! When adding content, either add a directory with
# `ipfs add -r` OR SINGLE FILE `ipfs add -w file` so a new directory gets
# created for the content and when it's used, the filename and type are
# remembered which may be helpful with media files or embeds.
# Note: no trailing slash after the URL, only https://domain.tld
ipfsGateway: https://eu.siderus.io

# eu.siderus.io is used, because they care about IPFS (being based around
# it) and they have a specific subdomain for getting European host.
# I cannot help them using Cloudflare (use IPFS Companion) and other
# alternatives possibly didn't care about IPFS as much or would require me
# to use a provider outside of the Europe.
