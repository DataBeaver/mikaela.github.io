I am https://t.me/M1kaela at Telegram, but as per their username policy[1]
I am unable to reserve the name there due to not being a user of Facebook,
Twitter or Instagram and I have no desire to become one.

[1]:https://telegram.org/faq#q-what-do-i-do-if-my-username-is-taken

This means that theoretically anyone could takeover any Telegram username
I register and thus my account there should be confirmed outside of Telegram
to ensure I am being chatted with, not someone who registered my username at
two of three of those services and thus got the username transferred to
them.

Coming to this file from Telegram? For other options reaching me, check
mikaela.info [2] or txt/accounts.txt [3] or just contact
xmpp:mikaela@blesmrt.net or @mikaela:feneas.org (Matrix) directly. See
public keys of those accounts from keys.txt [4].
