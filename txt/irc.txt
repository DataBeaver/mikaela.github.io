List of IRC networks I am on and account names. Doesn't include networks
without nickname registration or where I have no channels or my identity
doesn't otherwise matter.

irc.ergo.chat: Mikaela
etro.mikaela.info: Mikaela
irc.libera.chat: Mikaela
irc.nixnet.services: Mikaela
irc.oftc.net: Mikaela
irc.pirateirc.net: MikaelaSuomalainen

Please feel free to ask if I am me or for me to add networks to this list.

Freenode: with the channel takeover issues and history of reading private
 messages, don't rely on Mikaela there being me or belonging to me.
