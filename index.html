<p id=bio>I am a Highly Sensitive Autistic Pirate with Linux experience from 2008. I am familiar with git and unemployed.</p>
<p class="centered">I speak Finnish, English and a little Esperanto. I am currently learning Czech.</p>

<hr/><br/>
<p>I am not good at talking about myself especially unprompted on my index page. Offline I will generally make a bad first impression, but the second impression will generally be better. <em>All my self-introductions also always feel like they are outdated the next day.</em></p>
<p>As said I have used Linux since 2008, I begun with <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> 8.04 and have used various other distributions after that, currently I am on <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> <a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/testing.en.html">Testing</a>, but I did also spend a long time with <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch</a>. I am a bit of distro and DE-hopper, even if currently I am currently using <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> which is just a window manager.</p>
<p>What do I do? My time flies with learning (languages and there is always something new on ICT field) where autism may be a bit of help, I am Instant Messaging manager at <a href="https://piraattipuolue.fi/en">Piraattipuolue (Pirate Party Finland)</a> which possibly talks about my interest towards messaging platforms and in addition to their servers I run a VPS, even if automagic mostly takes care of everything, but as anything could happen keeping an eye on what is happening won't hurt in moderation.</p>
<p>I like setting up OSes to always get updates from the closest point and as everyone should encrypt everything, I also use https with apt no matter how much someone else might say that to be unecessary, <a href="https://github.com/liske/needrestart">needrestart is also helpful</a>. I generally also run <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/">dnscrypt-proxy</a> to encrypt DNS and have moved my internal connections mostly to <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/">Yggdrasil network</a> having <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/onion-services">Tor onion services</a> as a backup for SSH access. I always require key authentication.</p>
<p>The only traffic I am not encrypting is probably my WLAN. For some reason my router requires a reboot once per hour with WPA2 encryption while on open network I only have to reboot it once per day (I have asked about this confusing behaviour from wiser people on IRC and they weren't able to explain it either). I support the <a href="https://openwireless.org/">Open Wireless Movement</a> and think that if someone really wanted to cause me harm, they could break into the network anyway and that would be more difficult to prove on consumer grade device than the network being open. There are firewalls on all networks and while a passerby would be able to observe unencrypted SNIs, isn't that also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance">being done by international security agencies already</a> while even <a href="https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suomen_tiedustelulains%C3%A4%C3%A4d%C3%A4nt%C3%B6">Finland has given permission to monitor traffic crossing our borders</a> ((TODO: better link in English as the situation develops)and how much of traffic doesn't do that?). I also don't like being somewhere where the only available WLANs are printers and smart thermostats :)</p>

<p><a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> wishes this listing to exist on my index for cross-linking and <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth">IndieAuth<a/>, so here you go.

<h3 id="dev">Development</h3>

<p>I am mostly active on <a href="https://github.com/Mikaela" rel="me">GitHub</a>, but many projects also have their own instances and reqeuire separate registrations. During the "panic" of Microsoft buying GitHub, I started mirrorring some repos to <a href="https://gitea.blesmrt.net/mikaela" rel="me">Blesmrt's Gitea</a> while not personally being bothered by it.</p>

<h3 id="im">Instant messengers</h3>

<p>On my computer I have Keybase, Wire, Signal and XMPP (Gajim) on automatic startup, but not running all the time. <small><em>Yes, that is three electrons, please help me and my poor computers!</em></small></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://keybase.io/Mikaela" rel="me">Mikaela on Keybase.io</a>
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me it's mainly a end-to-end encrypted chat platform that is <a href="https://github.com/keybase/client/issues/15115">unusable on my phone</a>, but they also provide other services like cryptographic identity verification (which I prefer to do by this page (see also <a href="https://indieweb.org/homepage">Homepage on IndieWeb</a>)), <a href="https://www.stellar.org/">Stellar</a> Wallet, end-to-end encrypted file storage, etc.</li>
<li><s><a href="https://riot.im/app/#/user/@Ciblia:matrix.org" rel="me">@Ciblia:matrix.org on Riot/Matrix</a></s> <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/user/@mikaela:privacytools.io" rel="me">@mikaela:privacytools.io on Riot/Matrix</a>
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riot is the defacto client for the Matrix protocol which is in a friendly competition with XMPP, both of them are federated and wish to <em>bridge</em> everything into themselves. See also <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html">Try Matrix now</a> and <a href="{{site.address}}/keys#matrix">my Matrix fingerprints on my public keys page</a>. However my phone cannot run Riot well, so this is not a good place to attempt contacting me.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Matrix user you can contact me also through a bridge between Matrix and XMPP on <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/user/@_xmpp_mikaela=40blesmrt.net:matrix.org" rel="me">Matrix.org</a> <em>or you could if it wasn't currently down</em>.</li>
<li>I am on <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> with my main phone number <em>(please don't share them without my permission)</em>.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is widely agreed to be the most secure and privacy friendly instant messenger, its interface is very similar to Facebook WhatsApp and could be thought as a drop-in replacement for it. I am listing it here as a commitment of keeping my account there (under assumption they won't become another Facebook WhatsApp) and in hope that my contacts from Facebook WhatsApp may find Signal and me, if they end up on this page.</li>
<li>Mikaela on <a href="https://get.wire.com/">Wire</a>
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's the only fully end-to-end encrypted messaging platform that allows phone number registration on multiple platforms while supporting multiple devices (without depending on a single phone) and <em>the messaging app I picked to replace Facebook WhatsApp for my family</em>, I think it's my second preferred instant messaging platform after XMPP. I am also findable through email <em>(myname AT myname DOT info)</em> which can be used for registering instead (and/or in addition to) phone number. <a href="https://github.com/wireapp/wire/issues/240">Wire doesn't have public profile links.</a> See also <a href="{{site.address}}/keys#wire" rel="me">my Wire fingerprints on my public keys page.</a></li>
<li><a href="xmpp:mikaela@blesmrt.net" rel="me">mikaela AT blesmrt DOT net on XMPP</a>
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My preferred federated instant messaging protocol, <em>the universal messaging standard (since 1999)</em>, has all the modern features including end-to-end-encryption between multiple devices and being lightweight with clients available for possibly any platform. (On the friendly competition with Matrix, XMPP <em>transports</em> everything into itself.) See also <a href="{{site.address}}/keys#omemoxmpp" rel="me">OMEMO on my public keys page.</a> and <a href="https://xmpp.org/getting-started/">getting started with XMPP</a>.</li>
